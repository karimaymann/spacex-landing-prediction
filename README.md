# 🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

A practice project to learn data science and machine learning fundamentals by exploring and modeling SpaceX launch data.

---

## 🧠 Overview
This project is part of my data science learning journey.  
The goal is to understand how to:
- Work with real-world data,
- Explore it visually,
- And eventually build a model that predicts whether a Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.

For now, the focus is on **data collection**, **cleaning**, and **basic exploration**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
1. Learn how to load and inspect real datasets.  
2. Perform simple data cleaning and transformation.  
3. Explore key features using visualizations.  
4. Prepare the data for future modeling.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pandas**, **numpy**
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn**

*(More libraries will be added as the project grows.)*

---

## 📊 Dataset
I’ll be using publicly available SpaceX launch data, which can be obtained from:
- **SpaceX REST API**
- or datasets provided in the **IBM Data Science Capstone Project**

The dataset contains information about each launch, such as:
- Launch site  
- Payload mass  
- Orbit type  
- Booster version  
- Landing outcome  

---

## 🧩 Next Steps
- Load and explore the dataset.  
- Handle missing values and clean the data.  
- Visualize basic relationships between features.  
- Prepare for modeling in later stages.
